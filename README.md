initial commit 

an application that downloads data from http://api.nbp.pl (i.e. USD rate in relation to PLN), creates some test objects of given parameters, counts price according to an USD rate for a given day, puts them in a sortable MySQL database that allows searching using a name or a date and also writes data to an .xml file

application is executable from DemoApplication.class, although more advanced functionalities are to be added in due time, hence it's a SpringBoot project
